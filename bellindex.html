Laziness sparks creativity though, and you are one of the most creative person I met. I don't really have anything to tell you as I believe we'll meet again, so here's the origin of my name.

If Agnes told you everything, you can see what happens if I become toxic. Apologies for the wrong conclusion. I am self-destructive to everything I know when I'm angry. Must be hurtful for you too. If you want to talk to me or listen to how disturbing I am when I hate myself, my Zalo is open."

Please tell Tia 'Pancake' to have him tell you a very disturbing story. Aside of that though, you are a very considerate person. Thank you for listening to my stories."

Then I fucked up because I don't know how to deal with you not wanting me around. I really want to be your friend, and I enjoyed your company greatly. My Zalo is open, and I really wish you could forgive me. I'm very sorry for what happened between us."
